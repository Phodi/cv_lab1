                    <h1>About Phodi</h1>
                    <p class="text"> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A proud student from countryside to a fine student in one of Thailand's best university. With a head full ideas, there is nothing this man can not accomplish.
                        <br><br> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Phodi is eager to try on new projects since he always thinks through trial and error so that he can reach the perfection. Since childhood, Phodi was always interested in creating stuffs
                        in-part due his child-like curiosity and his father being an electrician. One day, he got a brand new computer. From that day, his life has changed. With a computer, his creation can be more complex than it ever was.
                        He started from writing in-game automation script to create his own game which won the provincial compettion. With every step he takes, it taught him precious lessons that improve him even more.
                        <br><br> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Apart from computer, Phodi is also good at English. He had been to Thailand national English multi-skill compettion so communicating and presenting projects in English is not a problem for him.
